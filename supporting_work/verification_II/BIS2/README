#########################
Parses through the BIS2 output to find if BIS2 found interacting clusters and if so, if any of those clusters contain at least one residue from each protein 
Note that in order to run BIS2 on two proteins, those proteins must be concatenated end to end, so the presence of clusters is not enough of an indication of 
interaction since the cluster in question may only contain residues from one of the proteins and not the other
