#########################
Concatenates two fastas to one another by header name, separating each sequence with a string of 50 X's. This allowed us to run protein pairs on BIS2.
This script assumes that there are two groups of files to concatenate, unknown pairs and known pairs and that each pair is orgainised as follows: 
known|uknown/<protname1>_<protname2>/<protname1>_<protname2> and known|uknown/<protname1>_<protname2>/<protname2>_<protname1>
