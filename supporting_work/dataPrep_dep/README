runPrograms.sh is a wrapper program used to eliminate entries from both 
files that did not match up with the other (i.e. the set of headers had to 
be the same for both files)

Note that this is not required since we changed the behavior of mi_smart_filters.py
to filter out the non-matching records itself, requiring that fewer input files
be created. Originally each protein needed a pair-specific input file.
