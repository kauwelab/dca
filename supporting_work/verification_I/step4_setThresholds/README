Creates the dictionary of likelihood thresholds used in the final mi_smart_filters.py script. Determines the likelihood of interaction at 20 different 
thresholds based on the precision at that threshold scaled by the difference in sample size between the interacting and not-known-to-interact datasets. The precision is obtained by
looking at the scores from the interacting and not-known-to-interact tsv's generated by step 1 
getLikelihoodThresholds.py

ARGUMENT OPTIONS

getLikelihoodThresholds requires 3 user inputs:
--interacting:			[-i] The tsv of the scores from pairs known to interact generated by step 1 with the best hyper parameter combination as determined/chosen from steps 2 and 3
--unknown:			[-n] The tsv of the scores from not-known-to-interact pairs generated by step 1 with the best hyper parameter combination as determined/chosen from steps 2 and 3
--output:			[-o] The location and name of the output text file that will contain the python-formatted dictionary of the thresholds-to-likelihood

#########################
