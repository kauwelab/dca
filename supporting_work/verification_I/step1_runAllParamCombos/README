#########################

Runs the Mutual Information script (mi_smart_filters.py) on all interacting and not known to interact input for a given pairing of hyper parameters in order to test those hyper parameters
testSingleHyperParamCombo.py

#########################

ARGUMENT OPTIONS

testSingleHyperParamCombo requires 6 user inputs:
--percentAboveRandom:		[-r] the percent above random parameter being tested (for 10% enter 10)
--minPx:			[-p] the minimum px and py value being tested
--interactingInput		[-ii] the location of the directories containing the input fasta pairs of the interacting pairs. Each pair should be in its own directory named PROTEIN1_PROTEIN2.
 				This will automatically be the case if the user has created his or her input files using our other algorithms in ../dataPrep
--interactingOutput		[-io] the location of the directory for the output for the interacting data. Note that the output file will be named after its hyper parameters and should therefore have a different
 				location than the data not known to interact, otherwise the files will be combined.
--unknownInput			[-ui] the location of the directories containing the input fasta pairs of the pairs not known to interact. The same organization and naming convention for interacting data applies
--unknownOutput			[-uo] the location of the directory for the output for the case data. Again, give a different location than the interacting data.

REQUIREMENTS

testSingleHyperParamCombo.py uses python 3.7 in a Linux environment

Python Libraries:
1. argparse

If any of these libraries are not in your current path, use the following command:
pip3 install --user [library_name]

USAGE EXAMPLE
Another script was used to generate slurm scripts for each possible hyper parameter combination for both vertebrates and bacteria.
If used in the current directory, the slurm scripts would have looked something like the following:

python testSingleHyperParamCombo.py -r 13 -p 17 -ii ../../exampleData/vertebrates/data/interact/ -io ../../exampleData/vertebrates/results/interact -ui ../../exampleData/vertebrates/data/unknown/ -uo ../../exampleData/vertebrates/results/unknown/

Please note that not all test data was included on this repo. See the example data directory for a list of all pairings used.
