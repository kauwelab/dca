Creates the dictionary of likelihood thresholds used in the final mi_smart_filters.py script. Determines the likelihood of interaction at 20 different 
thresholds based on the precision at that threshold scaled by the difference in sample size between the cases and controls. The precision is obtained by
looking at the scores from the case and control tsv's generated by step 1 
getLikelihoodThresholds.py

ARGUMENT OPTIONS

getLikelihoodThresholds requires 3 user inputs:
--inputCase:			[-i] The tsv of the case scores generated by step 1 with the best hyper parameter combination as determined/chosen from steps 2 and 3
--controls:			[-n] The tsv of the control scores generated by step 1 with the best hyper parameter combination as determined/chosen from steps 2 and 3
--output:			[-o] The location and name of the output text file that will contain the python-formatted dictionary of the thresholds-to-likelihood

#########################
