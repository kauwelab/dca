#########################

mutualInfo calculates the mutual information between positions on two differnt genes. 
It uses protein fasta files with MSA's of several species, each file containing exactly the same list of species, 
to determine the mutual information between the two genes. A CSV of values and a heatmap are both provided.

#########################

ARGUMENT OPTIONS

mutualInfo requires 4 user inputs:
 -file1:			INPUT fasta file with MSA's of the first gene. Must be a fasta file, and sequences must be aligned
 -gene1:			the name of the first gene
 -file2:			INPUT fasta file with MSA's of the second gene. Same restrictions apply as file1
 -gene2:			the name of the second gene

Optional Arguments:
 --color 			[-c] the matplotlib color scheme name for the heatmap. Options include "viridis", "inferno", "plasma", "magma", "greys", "purples"
 				"blues", "Greens", "Oranges", "Reds", "YlOrBr", "YlOrRd", "OrRd", "PuRd", "RdPu", "BuPu", "GnBu", "PuBu", "YlGnBu", "PuBuGn", 
				"BuGn", "YlGn", "binary", "gist_yarg", "gist_gray", "bone", "pink", "gray", "spring", "summer", "autumn", "winter", "winter", 
				"cool", "Wistia", "hot", "amfhot", "gist_heat", or "copper". 

--output                        [-o] the desired name of the output files (without file extensions). Default will be "gene1_gene2.csv" and "gene1_gene2.png"

--noheatmap    			[-m] select this option to opt out of the creation of a heatmap of the data. Only the csv will be generated. 

--threads			[-t] the desired number of threads for the program to run on. Default is 40 (all). 

--filter			[-f] the lowest possible hamming distance that a sequence can have between itself and any other sequence and still be considered part of the alignment.
				Note that only one of the sequences in this comparison will be removed from consideration. Default is 0.02
