#########################

Calculates the mutual information between positions on two differnt proteins and gives a probability of interaction based on that score.
Uses two protein multiple sequence alignment files, each containing the same set of at least 100 different species,
to provide a score of interaction between each residue on the two proteins. 
A CSV file and heat map of those scores are created and/or a tsv detailing the highest score, its location, and its probability of interaction.

ARGUMENT OPTIONS

mi_smart_filters requires 4 user inputs:
--fasta1:			[-f1] fasta file with MSA's of the first gene. Must be a fasta file, and sequences must be aligned

--fasta2:			[-f2] fasta file with MSA's of the second gene. Must be a fasta file, and sequences must be aligned

--protein1			[-p1] the name of the first protein

--protein2			[-p2] the name of the second protein


Optional Arguments:
--color 			[-c] The matplotlib color scheme of the heatmap.

--dataname			[-d] The filepath to the output csv. Default name made from protein names and written to the current directory.

--nodata			[-xi] Flag to not create a csv.

--imagename			[-i] The filepath to the output png of the heat map. Default name made from protein names and written to the current directory.

--noimage    			[-xi] Flag to not create a heatmap. 

--threads			[-t] The number of threads, default all. 

--noneg				[-n] Change all negative values to zero exclusively for the creation of the heatmap so that high values stand out more

--minPx				[-p] Minimum percentage of the domain that a residue needs to make up to count towards the MI score.

--percentAboveRandom		[-r] Minimum percentage above random that a pairing should occur to be factored into MI scores.

--highestScore			[-s] Flag to record only the highest mutual information score, its position, and its chance of interaction in a tsv. Also provide the filename (e.g. -s allMaxes.tsv)
				This option appends to a file and is intended for large analyses with several protein pairs where they can all have their results written to the same file. 

--taxonomicGroup		[-g] The taxonomic group of the input files. Flag to use the best values for percentAboveRandom and minPx as determined by our research. Input b or bacteria, v or vertebrates
